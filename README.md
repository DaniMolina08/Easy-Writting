TOEIC EASY WRITING is a project oriented to be a simulator of the Writing section of TOEIC, which provides practical, comfortable, and accessible supporting materials. 
 
The exclusivity of the test makes the materials on the internet to practice this type of skills very scarce and limited. That's why, we had the initiative to develop an app and website to share TOEIC Speaking & Writing certification practice material with everyone. 

Anyone who is interested in practicing TOEIC-oriented writing skills will be benefited from our project, especially the new students' generations who will have access to this material to familiarize themselves with the test during their third year in ¡Supérate!. 

With this project, we have innovated in a way these skills are practiced, the way ¡Supérate! Students approach the test and the way this material is distributed, as anyone with internet access can browse our website and download the app for free, for the time being.
